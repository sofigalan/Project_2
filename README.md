Information on Earthquakes in Mexico

Project Team: Ana Sofia Galan, Juan Eduardo Delgado, José Marcos Marmolejo

Information: Our project will gather data from USGS API on real time information for earthquakes and information provided on Twitter by the count @SkyAlertMx

Project description: Our inspiration comes from constant earthquake activities in Mexico, and specially from september 2017 earthquake.
For this project, we'll be gathering information for recents earthquakes on: magnitude, coordinates, date and place to create different map visualizations on current earthquakes. As a first exercise we'll be showing a heatmap with locations with the most earthquake activity. User we’ll be able to interact with the information to create maps by date, zone and magnitude. 
In the main page, information taken from twitter on last earthquake activity will be included.
